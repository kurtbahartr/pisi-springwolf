        <Summary xml:lang="en">Neofetch with pride flags!</Summary>
        <Description xml:lang="en">HyFetch, which also has the role of being an updated version of Neofetch, is a Neofetch mod aimed towards LGBTQ+ members. The reason why there's no patch for it in my PiSi repo is because it conatins the patches Pisi Linux maintainers use on the original Neofetch downstream.</Description>
